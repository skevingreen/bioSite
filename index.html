          <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
          <p>
            Kelli has been a board member of the charitable organization AZ Blankets 4 Kids for over for over 20 years.  In that time, she has served as president, vice president, and chair of communications.  This wonderful non-profit organization was created to "provide comforting blankets and quilts to seriously ill and traumatized children" in the greater Phoenix area.  Through their efforts, they have delivered over 150,000 blankets as of January of 2023.  Click or tap the image to find out more about AZ Blankets 4 Kids.

            Kelli (or Sign Girl as she has come to be known) has also been a graphic artist in the facilities management group at Arizona State University (ASU) for over 30 years.  Her career has afforded her many opportunities to help guide and celebrate faculty, staff, and students.  Kelli has all the bases covered whether it's designing trophies, creating tactile Braille signs, making faculty nameplates, or installing directional signage as just a few examples.

          <h1>Goals</h1>
          <p>
            As Kelli's long career with ASU is winding down, she is beginning to set her sights on retirement.  So, what's next for Kelli?  Rest assured that her talents will not go to waste.  Kelli will be refocusing her creative efforts on personal projects with an eye towards establishing an e-commerce site and traveling more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Kelli already has a Bachelor of Science in English for Information Systems from Dakota State University with specializations in technical writing and desktop publishing, she would like to return to school at ASU to pursue a BS in Graphic Information Technology (User Experience) to further her aspirations to start her own business.
