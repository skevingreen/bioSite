      <h1>A Little About Kelli</h1>
      <p>
        Kelli was born in Rapid City, South Dakota where she lived until 6 years old.  She then moved 112 miles away with her mother to the tiny town of Midland (pop. 200) so that they could take care of her great grandparents.  Kelli still has family in Rapid City and Midland, including her stepdad who she visits every other year. Kelli and her mother attended services at St. Williams Catholic Church where they could often be found keeping the little children busy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelli went to Midland High School and graduated in a class of 16.  Her favorite subject was English, and she played the flute in band.  To this day, Kelli loves to read and write.  Kelli also had aspirations to attend fashion school at the University of Delaware, but decided in the end to stay a little closer to home and attend Dakota State University.
      </p>

        When Kelli wasn't attending school she had a number of jobs.  From 13 to 17 years of age, Kelli helped her dad out on their wheat farm/cattle ranch.  Kelli also had a paper route delivering the Huron Daily Plainsman, which she picked up at the Stroppel Hotel when it was delivered by bus.  When the weather was nice, she used her bike to make her route.  In the harsher winter months, Kelli's mom would often drive her along the route.  Other jobs included making cookies for sale at the restaurant where her mom worked and cleaning hotel rooms.  Kelli's mother also had a beauty salon in their home, and it was through a client of her mother's than Kelli would later land a job working concessions at Mt. Rushmore.
      </p>
      <p>
        For fun, one of Kelli's favorite activities was swimming.  The local pool charged $1 to swim all day, and Kelli frequently took advantage this offer.  Kelli and her mother also enjoyed crafting and making Christmas treats for friends and family.  They payed special attention to lonely elderly folks in the community to whom they would sing Christmas carols when making their deliveries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Towards the end of her college career, Kelli took an internship with Eros Data Center (a satellite imaging company) where she did desktop publishing and worked with programmers to create software manuals.  She thought for awhile that she would pursue this line of work as a career, but on a whim she applied for a job in De Smet, SD (made famous as the "Little Town on the Prairie" by Laura Ingalls Wilder).  There she worked designing highway signs for Lyle Signs.  Kelli would later move to Arizona to work in the sign shop for Arizona State University where she is still working today.
