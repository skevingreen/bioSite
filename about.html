        <h1>A Little About Kelli</h1>
        <p>
          Kelli was born in Rapid City, South Dakota where she lived until 6 years old.  She then moved 112 miles away with her mother to the tiny town of Midland (pop. 200) so that they could take care of her great grandparents.  Kelli still has family in Rapid City and Midland, including her stepdad who she visits every other year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelli went to Midland High School and graduated in a class of 16.  Her favorite subject was English, and she played the flute in band.  To this day, Kelli loves to read and write.  Kelli also aspired to attend fashion school at the University of Delaware but decided in the end to stay a little closer to home and attend Dakota State University.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Kelli wasn't attending school she had several jobs.  From 13 to 17 years of age, Kelli helped her dad out on their wheat farm/cattle ranch.  Kelli also had a paper route delivering the Huron Daily Plainsman, which she picked up at the Stroppel Hotel when it was delivered by bus.  When the weather was nice, she used her bike to make her route.  In the harsher winter months, Kelli's mom would often drive her along the route.  Other jobs included making cookies for sale at the restaurant where her mom worked and cleaning hotel rooms.  Kelli's mother also had a beauty salon in their home, and it was through a client of her mother's than Kelli would later land a job working concessions at Mt. Rushmore.
